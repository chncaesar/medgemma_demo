  "prompt": "A 62-year-old right-hand dominant male presents with 3 months of progressive right shoulder pain. The pain is located over the lateral shoulder and worsens at night, often waking him from sleep. He has difficulty reaching overhead and behind his back. He denies any trauma but works as a painter. On examination, there is weakness with resisted abduction and external rotation. What is the likely diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and recommended evaluation?",
